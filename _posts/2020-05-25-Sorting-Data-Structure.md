I would like to list some data structures that has characteristic of sorting embedded in it.

1. TreeSet & TreeMap
2. Heap
3. Comparator
4. BST
5. Swap + Two Pointers

When we solve a problem with sorting techniques, we can always try to solve the problem by going through the list above. TreeSet and TreeMap are sorted in ascending order by default. PriorityQueue sorts the data in ascending order by default. Creating Comparator class can help override the default sorting method, define and customize the sorting rule by yourself. BST will be sorted in ascending order if you print it in order.

The first 3 data structure could play an important rule when solvin some problem related to sorting.
