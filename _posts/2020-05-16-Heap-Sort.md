### 1. Binary Heap - Data Structure
A binary heap is a specialized *binary tree-based* data structure which is essentially an ***almost complete tree*** that satisfies the binary heap property. There are two types of binary heaps, max-heaps and min-heaps.
> A Complete Tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible. A complete tree must be a balanced tree.
> Max Heap: for every node $i$, other than the root,
