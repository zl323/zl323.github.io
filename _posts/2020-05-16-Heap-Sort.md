### 1. Binary Heap - Data Structure
A binary heap is a specialized *binary tree-based* data structure which is essentially an ***almost complete tree*** that satisfies the binary heap property. There are two types of binary heaps, max-heaps and min-heaps.
> A **Complete Tree** is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible. A complete tree must be a balanced tree.
> 
> **Max Heap Property**: for every node $i$, other than the root, $A[Parent(i)] \geq A[i]$, that is, the value of a node is at most the value of its parent. Thus, the largest element in a max-heap is stored at the root, and the subtree rooted at a node contains values no larger than that contained at the node itself.
>
> **Min Heap Property**: Conversely, for every node $i$ other than the root, $A[Parent(i)] \leq A[i]$. The smallest element in a min-heap is at the root.

Due to its complete tree property, each node of the tree corresponds to an element of the array. Thus, We have the following conversion between array index and heap.
{% highlight java linenos %}
// i is the index in the array
PARENT(i):
  return floor(i/2)
LEFT(i):
  return 2*i
RIGHT(i):
  return 2*i+1
{% endhighlight %}

A more detailed example can be seen in the figure below.

> Viewing a heap as tree, we define the height of a node in a heap to be number of edges on the longest simple downward path from the node to a leaf, and we define the height of the heap to be the height of its root. Since a heap of n elements is based on complete tree, its height is $\lfloor{logn}\rfloor$.
