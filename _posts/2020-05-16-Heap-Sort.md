### 1. Binary Heap - Data Structure
A binary heap is a specialized *binary tree-based* data structure which is essentially an ***almost complete tree*** that satisfies the binary heap property. There are two types of binary heaps, max-heaps and min-heaps.
> A Complete Tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible. A complete tree must be a balanced tree.
> 
> Max Heap: for every node $i$, other than the root, $A[Parent(i)] \geq A[i]$, that is, the value of a node is at most the value of its parent. Thus, the largest element in a max-heap is stored at the root, and the subtree rooted at a node contains values no larger than that contained at the node itself.

### 2. Maintaining the Heap Property
