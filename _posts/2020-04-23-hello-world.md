Welcome！
My name is Michael Li. I'm currently a Master Student at University of Pennsylvania. This summer I will be joining Samsung as Backend Platform Software Engineer Intern. I am looking forward to developing a software engineer career after graduation in 2021.

This website is for personal interests. I will mainly post some blogs about Data Structures and Algorithms. Depending on my interests, I will probably post some technical blogs regarding backend technology stacks.

No matter you are a CS master or rookie, hope you could enjoy reading my blogs!
